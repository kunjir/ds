1. Write an R program to extract first 10 English letter in lower case and last 10 letters in upper case and extract letters between 22nd to 24th letters in upper case.
# Define the English alphabet
alphabet <- letters

# Extract the first 10 English letters in lowercase
first_10_lowercase <- alphabet[1:10]
print("First 10 English letters in lowercase:")
print(first_10_lowercase)

# Extract the last 10 English letters in uppercase
last_10_uppercase <- toupper(tail(alphabet, 10))
print("Last 10 English letters in uppercase:")
print(last_10_uppercase)

# Extract letters between 22nd to 24th positions in uppercase
between_22_24_uppercase <- toupper(alphabet[22:24])
print("Letters between 22nd to 24th positions in uppercase:")
print(between_22_24_uppercase)

2.Write a script in R to create a list of students and perform the following Give names to the students in the list.Add a student at the end of the list.Remove the first Student.Update the second last student.
# Create a list of students
students <- list("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David")

# Give names to the students in the list
names(students) <- paste("Student", 1:length(students))

# Print the list of students with names
print("List of students with names:")
print(students)

# Add a student at the end of the list
new_student <- "Emily"
students <- c(students, new_student)

# Print the list of students after adding a new student
print("List of students after adding a new student:")
print(students)

# Remove the first student
students <- students[-1]

# Print the list of students after removing the first student
print("List of students after removing the first student:")
print(students)

# Update the second last student
students[length(students) - 1] <- "Michael"

# Print the list of students after updating the second last student
print("List of students after updating the second last student:")
print(students)
