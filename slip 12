1. Write an R program to convert a given matrix to a list and print list in ascending order
# Example matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(c(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9), nrow = 2)

# Convert matrix to a list
my_list <- as.vector(my_matrix)

# Print the list before sorting
print("List before sorting:")
print(my_list)

# Sort the list in ascending order
sorted_list <- sort(my_list)

# Print the sorted list
print("List in ascending order:")
print(sorted_list)

2.Consider Weather dataset i) Selecting using the column number ii) Selecting using the column nameiii) Make a scatter plot to compare Wind speed and temperature.
# Load the necessary package containing the Weather dataset (if not already loaded)
# library(package_name)

# Assuming 'weather_dataset' is the name of your dataset

# Selecting using the column number
# Assuming Wind speed is column number 3 and Temperature is column number 5
wind_speed <- weather_dataset[, 3]
temperature <- weather_dataset[, 5]

# Selecting using the column name
# Assuming Wind speed is named 'Wind' and Temperature is named 'Temp'
wind_speed <- weather_dataset$Wind
temperature <- weather_dataset$Temp

# Make a scatter plot to compare Wind speed and Temperature
plot(wind_speed, temperature, xlab = "Wind Speed", ylab = "Temperature", main = "Scatter Plot of Wind Speed vs Temperature")
