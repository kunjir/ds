1. Write a R program to get the unique elements of a given string and unique numbers of vector. [10]]
str1 = "Hello ! How are you?"
print("Original vector(string)")
print(str1)
print("Unique elements of the said vector:")
print(unique(tolower(str1)))
nums = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6)
print("Original vector(number)")
print(nums)
print("Unique elements of the said vector:")
print(unique(nums))

2. Write a R program to compare two data frames to find the row(s) in first data frame that are not present in second data frame [20] 
# Install and load the dplyr package if not already installed
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# Define the first data frame
df1 <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob", "Emily", "Michael")
)

# Define the second data frame
df2 <- data.frame(
  ID = c(2, 4),
  Name = c("Alice", "Emily")
)

# Compare two data frames to find the rows in the first data frame that are not present in the second data frame
rows_not_in_second <- anti_join(df1, df2)

# Print the rows in the first data frame that are not present in the second data frame
print("Rows in the first data frame that are not present in the second data frame:")
print(rows_not_in_second)
