1. Write a R program to merge two given lists into one list.[10 M]
# Define two lists
list1 <- list("a", "b", "c")
list2 <- list(1, 2, 3)

# Merge the two lists into one
merged_list <- c(list1, list2)

# Print the merged list
print(merged_list)

2. Consider Weather dataset i) Selecting using the column number ii)Selecting using the column nameiii) Make a scatter plot to compare Windspeed and temperature.[20 M]

wind_speed <- weather_dataset[, 3]
temperature <- weather_dataset[, 5]

# Selecting using the column name
# Assuming Wind speed is named 'Wind' and Temperature is named 'Temp'
wind_speed <- weather_dataset$Wind
temperature <- weather_dataset$Temp

# Make a scatter plot to compare Wind speed and Temperature
plot(wind_speed, temperature, xlab = "Wind Speed", ylab = "Temperature", main = "Scatter Plot of Wind Speed vs Temperature")
