1. Write a R program to multiply two vectors of integers type and length 3.
# Define two vectors of integers
vector1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
vector2 <- c(4, 5, 6)

# Multiply the two vectors element-wise
result <- vector1 * vector2

# Print the result
print("Result of multiplying two vectors element-wise:")
print(result)

2.Write a R program to save the information of a data frame in a file and display the information of the file. 
# Create a sample data frame
my_data <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 35),
  Gender = c("Female", "Male", "Male")
)

# Save the data frame to a CSV file
write.csv(my_data, file = "my_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Read the CSV file back into R
read_data <- read.csv("my_data.csv")

# Display the information of the file
print("Information of the file:")
print(read_data)
