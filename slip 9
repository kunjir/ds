1. Write a R program to find nth highest value in a given vector. [10 M]
# Function to find nth highest value in a vector
find_nth_highest <- function(vector, n) {
  sorted_vector <- sort(unique(vector), decreasing = TRUE)
  if (n <= length(sorted_vector)) {
    nth_highest <- sorted_vector[n]
    print(paste("The", n, "highest value in the vector is:", nth_highest))
  } else {
    print("Error: n exceeds the length of the vector.")
  }
}

# Example vector
example_vector <- c(10, 5, 20, 15, 30)

# Test the function with the example vector and n = 2
find_nth_highest(example_vector, 2)

2.Write a script in R to create a list of students and perform thefollowingGive names to the students in the list.Add a student at the end of the list.Remove the first Student.Update the second last student.
# Create a list of students
students <- list("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David")

# Print the initial list of students
print("Initial list of students:")
print(students)

# Give names to the students in the list
names(students) <- c("Student1", "Student2", "Student3", "Student4")

# Print the list of students with names
print("List of students with names:")
print(students)

# Add a student at the end of the list
new_student <- "Emily"
students <- c(students, new_student)

# Print the list of students after adding a new student
print("List of students after adding a new student:")
print(students)

# Remove the first student
students <- students[-1]

# Print the list of students after removing the first student
print("List of students after removing the first student:")
print(students)

# Update the second last student
students[length(students) - 1] <- "Michael"

# Print the list of students after updating the second last student
print("List of students after updating the second last student:")
print(students)
