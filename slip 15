1. Write a R program to list containing a vector, a matrix and a list and give names to the elements in the list.[10 M]
# Create a vector
my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Create a matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)

# Create a list
my_list <- list(
  Vector = my_vector,
  Matrix = my_matrix,
  Another_List = list("a", "b", "c")
)

# Assign names to the elements in the list
names(my_list) <- c("My_Vector", "My_Matrix", "My_List")

# Print the list
print(my_list)

2.Write a R program to create a factor corresponding to height of womendata set, which contains height and weights for a sample of women.
# Example dataset containing height and weight for a sample of women
women_data <- data.frame(
  Height = c(160, 165, 170, 175, 180),
  Weight = c(55, 60, 65, 70, 75)
)

# Define the breaks for height categories (for example)
breaks <- c(150, 160, 170, 180, 190)

# Create a factor corresponding to height
height_factor <- cut(women_data$Height, breaks = breaks, labels = c("Short", "Average", "Tall", "Very Tall"))

# Print the factor corresponding to height
print("Factor corresponding to height:")
print(height_factor)
